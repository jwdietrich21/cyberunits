Bricks Notes

Bricks is a set of Pascal units that provides a class library for rapid programming of high-performance computer simulations in life sciences.

In order to use the Bricks Library in your own enterprises you simply have to add the file "bricks.pas" to your project. You may also want to add additional units like "lifeblocks.pas" or "systemsdiagram.pas" etc. to your project to get additional functionality. All high-level units depend from "bricks.pas", which has therefore to be added in any case.

In the directory "Example_Programs" you find sample programs that illustrate how to use the Bricks library.

Files in the directory "Test Cases for FPCUnit" are for unit testing with FPCUnit. They are not necessary for normal use, except for the case that you want to improve and test the Bricks Library.
